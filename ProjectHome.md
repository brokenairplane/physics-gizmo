Science equipment can be expensive and yet many of your students have Android phones. Why not use the sensors, processing power, and connectivity of the phone to collect, analyze, and share data?

If you are looking for the app, go to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brokenairplane.physicsGizmo).

Be advised that data varies from phone to phone and the sensors were not intended for this purpose so all data is for educational purposes only.

This app was developed out of a desire to see data collection and analysis become more affordable for students, please keep that goal in mind as you work on this project and others like it.

Note: This source is for Android phones 2.1 and higher because of the dependency on Bluetooth.
