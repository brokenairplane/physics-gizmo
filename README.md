I was inspired to develop Physics Gizmo when a fellow Physics teacher and I were talking about the cost of sensor equipment. Now that so many students have cell phones, we might as well put them to good use.

You can use the app to record the acceleration of the phone or an object passing in front of the phone. I made the app open source in case others are interested in adding in the other sensors into the app. You may also want to be inspired by it while making your own app. That's great too. This was my first Android app and I would not have been able to do it without others code and examples.

More information about the app can be found at the BrokenAirplane Education Blog http://www.brokenairplane.com/2011/10/android-education-science-physicsgizmo.html
